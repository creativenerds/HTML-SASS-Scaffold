# HTML-SASS-Scaffold
SASS HTML Scaffold is front-end HTML and SASS template to allow you to rapidly get up and running developing your web project. It's simple bare bones template so can be easily adapted to your web proeject.

The starter template is something, which is always the starting point for myself when building a web page, and thought GIT Hub would be the perfect place to host it and to share with other developers to uterlize.
